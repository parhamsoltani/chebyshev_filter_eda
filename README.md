## Overview

This tool implements various classical and modern synthesis methods for Chebyshev filter design. In many situations, it is more important to have the approximation uniformly good across the entire passband. A filter that has this uniform approximating property is the Chebyshev filter. The magnitude response of the Chebyshev filter ripples between two values in the passband. The number of ripples in the passband depends on the order n of the filter. The amplitude of the ripple is a free parameter. It's particularly useful for:

- RF/Microwave filter design
- Analog circuit design education
- Research in filter synthesis methods
- Comparative analysis of different realization techniques

For a lowpass filter, the magnitude function must go to zero as 𝜔→∞. Thus, the Chebyshev polynomials should be part of the denominator polynomials of the magnitude function of the filter, where 𝜖 is a free parameter that sets the ripple amplitude. By using the square of〖 𝜖𝑇〗_𝑛 (𝜔), both the numerator and the denominator of |𝐻(𝑗𝜔)|^2 are polynomials of 𝜔^2 and have positive values. Hence, we call a filter having a squared magnitude function a normalized low-pass Chebyshev filter (in short, Chebyshev filter) of order n.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required Python version
Python 3.7+
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Packages
```
numpy>=1.20.0
scipy>=1.7.0
matplotlib>=3.3.0
sympy>=1.8.0
```

### Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd chebyshev-filter-design
python chebyshev_filter.py
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```bash
python chebyshev_filter.py
```

The program will prompt you for the following parameters:

```
Enter N: 4
Enter e1: 0.5
Enter e2: 0.5
Do you want the design to be DC-drop-free? Press 1 for yes, 0 for no: 0
Enter Rg: 50
Enter RL: 50
```

This creates a 4th-order Chebyshev filter with moderate ripple in both sections.

## Parameter Guide

### N (Filter Order)
- **Range**: Integer ≥ 2
- **Description**: Determines the steepness of the filter transition
- **Common values**: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- **Impact**: 
  - Higher N → Steeper rolloff, more poles
  - Lower N → Gentler rolloff, simpler circuit

### e1 (First Section Ripple Factor)
- **Range**: Positive real number
- **Description**: Controls passband ripple in the first filter section
- **Relationship**: Ripple (dB) = 10 × log₁₀(1 + e1²)
- **Common values**:
  - `e1 = 0.1` → 0.043 dB ripple (very low ripple)
  - `e1 = 0.5` → 0.97 dB ripple (moderate ripple)
  - `e1 = 1.0` → 3.01 dB ripple (high ripple)

### e2 (Second Section Ripple Factor)
- **Range**: Positive real number
- **Description**: Controls passband ripple in the second filter section
- **Usage**: Often set equal to e1 for symmetric design

### DC-drop Configuration
- **0**: Allow DC drop (traditional Chebyshev response)
- **1**: DC-drop-free design (available only for even N)
- **Impact**: Affects the low-frequency behavior of the filter

### Rg (Source Resistance)
- **Range**: Positive real number (Ohms)
- **Description**: Generator/source resistance
- **Common values**: 50Ω, 75Ω, 300Ω

### RL (Load Resistance)
- **Range**: Positive real number (Ohms)
- **Description**: Load/termination resistance
- **Note**: Can be different from Rg for impedance transformation

## Synthesis Methods

### 1. Transmission Matrix Synthesis
Decomposes the filter into cascade of unit elements with ABCD parameters.
```python
synthesizer = TransmissionMatrixSynthesis(core)
T1, T2 = synthesizer.compute_transmission_matrices()
L1_vals, C1_vals, L2_vals, C2_vals = synthesizer.decompose_matrices(T1, T2)
```

### 2. Cauer Synthesis (LC Ladders)
Realizes the filter as a ladder network of inductors and capacitors.
```python
cauer = CauerSynthesis()
L_values, C_values = cauer.cauer_synthesis(impedance_function)
```

### 3. Active Synthesis Methods
Various methods for op-amp based implementations:
- **Kuh Method**: Admittance matrix approach
- **State Variable**: Using integrators and summers
- **Mitra Method**: Alternative active realization

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Low-Ripple Bandpass Filter
```python
# Design parameters for low-ripple filter
N = 5           # 5th order
e1 = 0.1        # Low ripple in first section
e2 = 0.1        # Low ripple in second section  
dc = 0          # Allow DC drop
Rg = 50         # 50Ω source
RL = 50         # 50Ω load
```

### Example 2: High-Selectivity Filter
```python
# Design parameters for sharp cutoff
N = 8           # 8th order for sharp transition
e1 = 1.0        # Higher ripple acceptable for sharper response
e2 = 1.0        
dc = 1          # DC-drop-free (if N is even)
Rg = 75         # 75Ω source
RL = 50         # 50Ω load (impedance transformation)
```

### Example 3: Educational/Analysis
```python
# Compare different synthesis methods
N = 4
e1 = 0.5
e2 = 0.5

# This will generate:
# - Pole-zero plots
# - Group delay plots  
# - Magnitude response
# - Component values for multiple synthesis methods
```

## Output Interpretation

### Plots Generated
1. **Pole Locations**: Shows filter stability and frequency response characteristics
2. **Group Delay**: Indicates phase linearity (important for signal integrity)
3. **Magnitude Response**: Shows passband ripple and stopband attenuation

### Component Values
The tool outputs component values for various realizations:
```
Transmission matrix decomposition:
L1 values: [0.123, 0.456, 0.789, ...]  # Inductor values in Henries
C1 values: [1.23e-9, 4.56e-9, ...]     # Capacitor values in Farads
L2 values: [0.234, 0.567, ...]
C2 values: [2.34e-9, 5.67e-9, ...]

Cauer synthesis F1 - L values: [0.145, 0.234, ...]
Cauer synthesis F1 - C values: [1.45e-9, 2.34e-9, ...]
```

### Understanding the Results
- **L values**: Inductance in Henries (for practical circuits, often mH or µH)
- **C values**: Capacitance in Farads (for practical circuits, often nF or pF)
- **Multiple methods**: Different synthesis approaches may give different component values for the same response

## Mathematical Background

### Chebyshev Polynomials
The tool uses Chebyshev polynomials Tₙ(x) defined by the recurrence:
- T₀(x) = 1
- T₁(x) = x  
- Tₙ(x) = 2x·Tₙ₋₁(x) - Tₙ₋₂(x)

### Filter Transfer Function
For a Chebyshev filter of order N:
```
|H(jω)|² = 1 / (1 + ε²Tₙ²(ω/ωc))
```
Where ε is the ripple factor and ωc is the cutoff frequency.

### Pole Locations
Chebyshev filter poles are located on an ellipse in the s-plane:
```
poles = -σₖ ± jωₖ
σₖ = sinh(β) sin(θₖ)
ωₖ = cosh(β) cos(θₖ)
β = (1/N) asinh(1/ε)
θₖ = (2k-1)π/(2N)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "N must be equal or greater than 2"
- Ensure filter order N ≥ 2
- Single-pole filters are not supported

#### "DC-drop-free design only available for even N"
- DC-drop-free option requires even filter order
- Set dc=0 for odd filter orders

#### "Function not suitable for Cauer synthesis"
- Some transfer functions cannot be realized as LC ladders
- Try different synthesis methods
- Check for negative component values

#### Poor numerical accuracy
- Reduce filter order for very high N
- Check input parameter ranges
- Ensure e1, e2 are reasonable values

### Performance Tips
- For high-order filters (N > 10), expect longer computation times
- Very small ripple factors (e < 0.01) may cause numerical issues
- Large impedance ratios (Rg/RL >> 10) may affect synthesis accuracy
